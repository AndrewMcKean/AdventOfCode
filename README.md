# AdventOfCode

Setting up a repo to track my Advent of Code solutions. This is the first year I'm taking part and I'm quite excited to see how it goes.

I'm making the choice to code in Python this year despite just finishing a java module with the OU as I prefer the syntax. If I have time I may 
try and solve the puzzles in Java as well.

Wish me luck!
